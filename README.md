# Risk-Aware Scene Sampling for Dynamic Assurance of Autonomous Systems

High-risk simulation scene generation has recently gained significant interest in the Autonomous Vehicle Domain. Traditional sampling-based approaches have been widely used for this purpose. **Passive samplers** like random search and grid search have been used in the industry. These samplers do not use the feedback of previous simulation results in the sampling process. To perform **active sampling**, we propose two new samplers called **Random Neighborhood Sampler (RNS)** and **Guided Bayesian Optimization (GBO)** in this work. These samplers are based on the conventional random and Bayesian Optimization search techniques and we add capabilities of active sampling, constraint-based sampling, and balancing the exploration vs. exploitation to guide them towards sampling clusters of high-risk scenes. We applied these samplers to an \ac{av} case study in CARLA Simulation. This repo has the steps to run the simulation scene generation with the samplers as discussed in the paper. For this, we leverage the CARLA Autonomous Driving Challenge https://leaderboard.carla.org/ . Some examples of the scenes generated in this work are shown in the figure below.

## Downloads

1. You will also need to install CARLA 0.9.9, along with the additional maps.
See [link](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.9) for more instructions.

2. Download the LEC weights from [here](https://vanderbilt365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/shreyas_ramakrishna_vanderbilt_edu/Eaq1ptU-YJJPrqmEYUK_dx8Bad2KqhVQZJkKwngWnuMWRA?e=U3dtyf). The LEC model architecture was taken from [Learning By Cheating](https://github.com/bradyz/2020_CARLA_challenge)

Save the model.ckpt file to carla-challange/carla_project folder. 

3. Download the trained B-VAE assurance monitor weights from [here](https://vanderbilt365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/shreyas_ramakrishna_vanderbilt_edu/EbB6W8s1XgFJg0Uv762w3v0BuAi7pOrYPZOnbmhHBlEKVQ?e=bOy4Rm)

Unzip and save the weights to carla-challange/leaderboard/team_code/detector_code/ood_detector_weights

## Setup Virtual Environment

To run the scene generation workflow with CARLA, clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shreyasramakrishna90/Resonate-Dynamic-Risk
```
Then, create a conda environment to run the experiments. 

```
To run this setup first create a virtual environment with python 3.7
conda create -n iccps python=3.7
cd ${repo}  # Enter into this repo
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running the Carla setup 

Run the simulator using the following command in one terminal. 

```bash
./CarlaUE4.sh -quality-level=Epic -world-port=3000 -resx=800 -resy=600 -opengl
```
In another terminal activate the virtual environment and run the following command.

```bash
conda activate iccps
./run_agent.sh n    #where n is the number of scenes to be generated. If not selected, 2 scenes will be generated by default.
```
This should start running the carla setup with the default random sampler. 

# Scene Generation & Samplers
We use a scenario description DSML written in [textX](https://textx.github.io/textX/stable/) to generate different temporal scene parameters (weather parameters, time-of-day,traffic density), spatial scene parameters (road segments) and agent sensor faults. These variables and samplers can be selected using the scene specification file ***carla-challange/sdl/scene/scene_description.yml***

# Samplers

The goal of this work is to test different samplers for sequential scene generation. We have integrated and the user can select from the following samplers.

1. **Manual Sampler** - A sampler in which the user can manually specify the values for the scene variables.
2. **Random Sampler** - A sampler in which the scene variables are sampled uniformly at random from their respective distributions.
3. **Grid Sampler** - A sampler that exhaustively samples all the combinations of the scene variables in a given grid.
4. **Halton Samppler** - A pseudo-random sampler that samples the search space using co-prime as its bases.
5. **Random Neighborhood Search** - The sampler executes the sequenctial-search strategy discussed in the paper.
6. **Guided Bayesian Optimization** - The sampler extends the conventional Bayesian Optimization sampler with sampling rules and uses them for sampling the high-risk scenes.
